# DogsandCats Recognition
  * Input: Dogs or Cats images.
  * Ouput: Classification Dogs or Cats. 
## Abstract
  *This project describes the machine learning method in the binary classification problem that distinguishes the two animals closest to humans: dogs and cats. Using three machine learning methods to perform the problem, including:*
  * *Logistic Regression* 
  * *Neural Network with One Hidden Layer* 
  * *Convolutional Neural Network.*
